<h2>
24 hours in Budapest
</h2>

<h3>
	With flights starting from £44 return from London, Budapest makes for a great city break at any time of the year. Temperatures can drop to the minuses but winter is a great time to experience the city on a budget.

<h3>By day</h3>
<p>With an abundance of cafes and bakeries, you’ll not be short of places to stop for breakfast. To save money, avoid breakfast in the hotel and explore the local area for places to eat. Some great recommendations include: <a href="https://en.lepetitbistrot.hu/">Le Petit Bistrot</a> (situated behind the Hungarian State Opera house), here you can get your hands on fresh cups of coffee and pancakes. 
<a href="http://fruccola.hu/">Fruccola</a>  is another popular choice. Fancy something familiar? This brunch spot is known for its healthy food and serves a range of British dishes. 
</p>
<p>
A great activity is to visit Budapest’s outdoor skating rink:<a href="https://www.mujegpalya.hu/en">Varosligeti Mujegpalyat</a>. Ticket prices for skating, cloakroom and skate hire start at around 1800 HUF (£4) plus a deposit for your hire.
</p>
<p>
Whilst you’re in the area, it is also worth paying a visit to the famous <a href="http://szechenyispabaths.com/">Szechenyi Baths</a> which are just a five minute walk away. Tickets to access all the baths, plus your own changing cabin start from around 5,600 HUF (£15). This is one of the more pricier attractions, but also one of the most beautiful. You can enjoy both the indoor and outdoor baths as well as the spa and cafes. 
</p>

<h3>By night</h3>
<p>Budapest on foot is just as beautiful by day as it is night. For spectacular views you can head up to Buda Castle or the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g274887-d276867-Reviews-Citadel-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html/">Citadella</a>, you can also enjoy drinks at the 360 bar in the city.</p>

<h3>Getting around</h3>
<p>The cheapest way to travel around the city it to use the local underground metro system. A single fare ticket price starts from around 90p, but if you’re visiting for a few days the most cost effective way is to buy a bulk of 10 tickets for 3,000 HUF (around £8.50). 

If you fancy seeing more of the sights, an open top bus is a great way to see the city overground. Ticket prices vary but tend to start from around 5,000 HUF (£15).
